# Discussion 7: Are You Having Fun?

50P/50R/0S

## Introduction

Complete `disc.ml` **without** defining any new functions (neither named
nor anonymous) or making any of the existing ones recursive. There should
be no `fun` in your file!

You may use anything from Pervasives, but may only use map and the folds
from the List module. All other modules are prohibited.
